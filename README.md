# Welcome to the Capstone Graveyard.

Capstones are year-long final projects students at Minerva University must complete to graduate. 

Inspired by a pitch Ingrid (M23) made in her Capstone Seminar class, the Capstone Graveyard is a place for those who have no idea what to do for their Capstone to get inspiration. Students can submit their project ideas that--for whatever reason--didn't work for them. Others can take these ideas and modify them. It's a launchpad from zero to one, giving aim to the aimless.

conda create --name capstone-graveyard python=3.8
conda activate capstone-graveyard

cd capstone-graveyard/
pip install -r requirements.txt
